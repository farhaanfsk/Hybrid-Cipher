# Hybrid-Cipher

Encryption algorithm with combination of caesar cipher and fibonacci series :


Encryption of the data is being used in many data processing areas. A lot of encryption algorithms have been developed for 
processing of data If we are able to join the advantages of the many existing encryption methods, then a new hybrid encryption 
method can be developed which offers better security and protection. So, in order to accomplish the Hybrid encryption technique, 
data encryption techniques using Fibonacci series, substitution techniques are studied and analyzed . We use layered encryption 
approach in this where the first layer is encrypted using a substitution technique  and second layer is encrypted using Fibonacci 
series and when  it comes to decryption we first apply the Fibonacci series as first layer and then apply the substitution 
technique in second layer to finally obtain the plain text



ADVANTAGES:

1.We generate a random key of random size.

2.The key gets appended to the plain text and is encrypted using the Fibonacci series

3.Since it follows layered approach even if one layer is decrypted the cryptanalyst would still get cipher text

4.Even if same plain text is used the cipher text obtained is different as we use the random key each time, By this chosen plain   
  text attack cannot be possible.
